# Workspace Path Memory

This file records descriptions of high-value file paths and their meanings to help the Agent run with long-term memory.

## High-Value Files

- `TOPIC.md`: The core research topic and goals for the current simulation experiment. Always read this file first to understand your mission.
- `.agentsociety/agent_classes/*.json`: JSON files containing detailed information about all supported agent classes, including their types and capabilities.
- `.agentsociety/env_modules/*.json`: JSON files containing detailed information about all supported environment modules that can be used to build simulation worlds.
- `.agentsociety/prefill_params.json`: Pre-filled parameters for modules to avoid repetitive input.

## Ignore Files

- `papers/`: The directory for storing literature search results or user-uploaded literature files. You SHOULD NOT read this directory directly, but use the `load_literature` tool to load the literature files.

## Progressive Context Loading

Instead of using specialized discovery tools, you should:
1. Read `.agentsociety/path.md` to understand the workspace structure.
2. List these directories to see available components.
3. Read specific JSON files as needed to gather detailed information about agent classes or environment modules.

## Custom Modules

- `custom/agents/`: Custom agent classes created by the user.
- `custom/envs/`: Custom environment modules created by the user.
